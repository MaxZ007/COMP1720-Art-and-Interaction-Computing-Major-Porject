# Interaction Statement

Write your interaction statement here (max 500 words).

Sketch One:
1.  Users will find a white button with content “Try Click BGM Button AND Me”, actually this button is a “Golden Snitch”, I got inspiration from a sports game named Quidditch in Harry Potter. It will randomly move to another place when users click it.
2.  Users can click the BGM button to start horror background music if they want. Just want to create an atmosphere of horror. For users friendly, I did not design default BGM.
3.  When users keep clicking the “Golden Snitch”, they will find all eyes always “watching” their cursor. That is one of the fearful elements in the project.
4.  Users can click anywhere, there will appear a blood-red breath circle, which like a bloodstain, inspiration from the horror movie Hannibal.
5.  There is a “blinking“ line words say, “PLEASE CLICK SPACE BUTTON !!”, I designed a clue here, when users click the space button, it will display a huge “SOS!” on the scene, which pushes to story development and make users curious to continue.

Sketch Two:
1.  Same as Sketch One, users can click the BGM button to get a better experience.
2.  Users will find a text “Welcome, Foolish mortals, try adjusting slider if you dare.” 
3.  Users will find three columns of axisymmetric “half-face” dolls from Dead Silence. Users can object slider to get centrosymmetric dolls. 
4.  In this sketch, I tried to make users feel scared and stimulate users to hesitate or quit. Users do not know what will happen in the next scene. Thus, they need to decide whether to continue.

Sketch Three:
1.  Different from Sketch One and Two, I choose some cheerful BGM, make users feel better after a fearful experience.
2.  Users can click the scene to get different welcome text, and the scene will change different colors, I tried to users get a strong visual impact.
3.  Users will find there are many balls drop slowly and they can click piano keys to play something on symmetric piano according to prompt. Users only know what normal piano looks like, but I design symmetric piano to make people deeper thinking like why rules are rules, etc.
4.  Users will find there are four centrosymmetric cursors, users can control them draw something in few seconds, I do not want to make it to a drawing board to attract users to  "drawing" because I tried users feel the pleasure to break common rules in few seconds, which I believe will make users deep impression on break rules.
