# Artist Statement

Write your artist statement in this file (max 500 words).

I will explain how my artwork addresses the theme in three parts. First, How I explore the theme and particular aspect of the theme that I focus on. Second, How I structure the experience. I try to make the viewer feel what. Third, What I try to make the viewer think and what I hope viewer talk about my artwork.

First of all. The theme is Fearful Symmetry. It is really hard for me to find connections between fearful and symmetry. Therefore, I try to divide it into two parts, I found a lot of fearful artworks and symmetric artworks, and then I found symmetric elements widely use in movies. By coincidence, I watched a lot of horror movies, e.g. The Shining, Dead Silence, Hannibal. Thus, I tried to figure out how directors use symmetric and fearful elements in movies so that I also can use them in my artwork. Thus, I learned many interesting things like Uncanny Valley, Trypophobia, etc. In my artwork, I used interactive storytelling like movies instead of PPT storytelling. Viewers can do anything whatever they want instead of complete instructions step by step. And I provide some clues to push story development.

Secondly. I designed three plots that correspond to three scenes in my project.  I tried to make the viewer feel fearful and enjoy my symmetric artworks.
* Beginning – Viewers feel curious and try clicking some buttons, then feel scared after they find clues.
* Middle – Fearful Symmetry, some viewers feel fearful then will stop continue, some will hesitantly.
* End – Overcome their fears and then enjoy funny symmetric artworks, make viewers feel happy, and inspire them deeper thinking.

Thirdly, the deeper message I tried to tell view is when we face unknown things, definitely we will feel curious and fearful, be yourself, and try to do something instead of completing constructions like a robot or accepting others' thinking. Just like appreciate a work of art, do not care about impressionism, modernism, realism, etc. Telling yourself about your real feelings. Only in this way, we can truly enjoy our life. I hope the viewer tell their friends like: “You know? I found an  interactive artwork that  interesting don’t like boring traditional artworks.”
